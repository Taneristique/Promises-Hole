title: “Promises Hole”
## General info
In this project after 3 seconds you opened index.php,you will see 4 different js promises.When you click them,each will locate you another webpage.
Two of the promises written after first one based on a random variables called x.For the promise put on div object with class name second if x is 
bigger than 0.4 promise will give you  "You are lucky,dude;)" sentence on this element otherwise "bad luck!".And for both when you click it will 
relocate you another page.For the div element with class name second will say  "You are really lucky,dude;)" in case x<0.5	and "bad luck" 
otherwise.But I strongly recommend you to refresh browser until you see bad luck! in 3rd element.You will lead to an inner site page with music 
designed by me.This is a really simple project designed with css viewport units js location.replace attribute js Promise object and .then consuming 
code.It is designed to be a little rabbithole in first web layer('feel free to see all layers from this url "https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DkeV0a5UcAEM8iv.png"').I hope you will like it:)
